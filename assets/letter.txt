SAGNIK, YOU ACADEMICALLY OVERPOWERED, CHEMICALLY OBSESSED, HEARTBREAK-SPEEDRUNNING PRODIGY,

HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY 🎉🔥📚🧪💀🦜✨
Another year of you flexing marks, solving numericals faster than WiFi, drawing like a Renaissance reincarnation, and still managing to fumble your love life like a clown juggling knives in a tornado. Inspiring. Truly. 😔👏

Since you’re a topper and probably expect a Nobel Prize–level essay, NO.
This is a birthday wish written by a brain running on fumes and disrespect.

Let’s begin:

First of all —
Your love life.
Bro.
It collapsed so hard NASA detected the emotional black hole.
Your ex is out there roaming with someone else like a lost NPC who found a side quest 💀🧍‍♀️➡️🧍‍♂️
And you?
You’ve locked your heart like it’s a CBSE question paper.
Can’t fall in love anymore?
Congratulations, you’re now an emotional refrigerator.
ICE mode ON. ❄️❤️

Second —
Your studies?
Unfair.
You understand chemistry so deeply that even molecules blush when you talk about them 🧪😳
Meanwhile the rest of the class is crying over moles and valency.
Your brain runs on caffeine and curiosity.
Everyone else runs on fear and prayers.

Third —
Art???
You draw so well it looks like your hands were forged by ancient gods while everyone else draws stick figures that look like they filed for bankruptcy.

Here is your BIRTHDAY GOD-TIER LOOT BOX:
🧠 → Processor-level brain (RGB lights included)
🧪 → A new element named after you (Sg— Sagnikium)
📘 → A chemistry book that actually understands YOU
💔 → Your failed love arc (collector’s edition)
💀 → Trauma pack (sealed, do not open)
🎨 → Art skills so sharp they can cut feelings
🥼 → Lab coat that gives +50 intelligence
🎂 → Cake (topper edition: 0% mistakes)
🔬 → Microscope to examine your life decisions
📚 → Books that you’ll finish before the rest even buy them

May this year bless you with:
• Marks so high the teacher gets suspicious
• A love story that doesn’t end like a tragic Bengali serial
• Chemistry questions that fear YOU
• Art skills that continue bullying humanity
• Emotional stability (optional, you probably won’t take it)
• And a heart that finally reboots from heartbreak mode

Alright, that’s enough chaos.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY YOU LIVING GOOGLE SEARCH ENGINE 🎉🔥🧪📚💀
Go dominate studies, slay art, and maybe — just MAYBE — fall in love without turning into a tragic poet.
